## Environment Setup 1. Create a new virtual environment: ```bash python -m venv jupyter_env
1. Activate the virtual environment:
* On Linux/macOS:


Copy
bash
Copy
source jupyter_env/bin/activate
* On Windows:


Copy
bash
Copy
jupyter_env\Scripts\activate
1. Install required packages:


Copy
bash
Copy
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow scikit-learn jupyter
Running the Project
1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated (you should see (jupyter_env) in your terminal prompt)
2. Navigate to the project directory:


Copy
bash
Copy
cd "~/Desktop/TU PHD/Project Apple-leaves-pathology/Apple Pathology Notebooks/ResNet"
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:


Copy
bash
Copy
jupyter notebook
1. Open the analysis notebook and run the visualization cells
Generated Visualizations
The code will generate six high-quality visualizations saved as PDF files:
1. performance_metrics.pdf: Bar plot of precision, recall, and F1-score by class
2. class_distribution.pdf: Pie chart showing distribution of samples
3. overall_metrics.pdf: Summary of model performance metrics
4. detailed_class_analysis.pdf: Detailed performance analysis by class
5. precision_recall_space.pdf: Precision-Recall space analysis
6. confusion_matrix.pdf: Confusion matrix with class-wise performance
Model Performance Summary
* Overall Accuracy: 94.16%
* Balanced Accuracy: 78.83%
* Total Parameters: 23,858,500
* Total Samples: 274
Class Distribution
* Healthy: 78 samples
* Multiple Diseases: 14 samples
* Rust: 93 samples
* Scab: 89 samples
